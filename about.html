      	<h1>About Interval Trainer</h1>
	<p>This is a simple tool I use to practice following music
	  intervals. It was born out of discussion with several other
	  musicians about short games to play to practice music
	  theory and study for exams.</p>
	<h2>How to Use</h2>
	<p>The game keeps track of a note on the twelve-note scale,
	and presents an interval. It always starts on C. You, the
	reader, are meant to keep clicking on the interval to get a
	new one while keeping track, mentally, of where the current
	  keyboard note is.</p>
	<p>For example, if the display shows the
	interval <bold>M6</bold> and the current keyboard note is C,
	then you can mentally keep track of the note as a major sixth
	  above C. Click on the interval to get a new one.</p>
	<p>If at any point you lose track of where you are, click
	"Show Answer" to see a graphical representation of the
	keyboard with the current note highlighted.</p>
